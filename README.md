# Walmart USA Advanced Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program - June 2024

I successfully completed the Advanced Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program at Walmart, hosted on Forage, in June 2024. This program involved a series of challenging technical projects designed to simulate real-world tasks and provide hands-on experience in software engineering.The four tasks are:
 - Advanced Data Structure
 - Software Architecture
 - Relational Database Design
 - Data Munging

Here are the key projects I worked on:

## Heap Data Structure Development
- Developed a novel version of a heap data structure in Java for Walmart’s shipping department.
- This project required strong problem-solving abilities and a deep understanding of algorithmic principles.
- The enhanced data structure aimed to optimize the efficiency of shipping operations, demonstrating my capability to create practical solutions to complex problems.

## UML Class Diagram Design
- Designed a UML class diagram for a data processor, taking into account different operating modes and database connections.
- This task involved analyzing the requirements and architecting a scalable and maintainable system design.
- My ability to visualize and plan the system architecture was crucial in ensuring the data processor could handle various operational scenarios.

## Entity Relationship Diagram Creation
- Created an entity relationship diagram to design a new database for Walmart’s pet department.
- The diagram was developed to meet all specified requirements, ensuring data integrity and efficient retrieval.
- This project showcased my skills in database design and my attention to detail in capturing the relationships and constraints of the data entities.

## Skills and Competencies Demonstrated
- **Java Programming:** Advanced proficiency in Java, applied to develop complex data structures.
- **Algorithm Design:** Strong understanding of algorithms and data structures, essential for optimizing performance.
- **System Design:** Ability to design comprehensive UML class diagrams, reflecting a deep understanding of object-oriented principles.
- **Database Design:** Proficiency in creating entity relationship diagrams, ensuring robust and efficient database schemas.
- **Problem-Solving:** Demonstrated ability to tackle challenging technical problems and deliver effective solutions.

This virtual internship experience at Walmart provided me with valuable insights into advanced software engineering practices and honed my technical skills, preparing me for future challenges in the field.
